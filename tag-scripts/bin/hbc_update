###  hbc_update
###
### A nice, simple script which performs updates of Homebrew and Caskroom

### mechanism of sorts, but I like things verbose.
### UPDATE ALL THE THINGS!!!!
 
brew update && brew upgrade --all && brew cleanup
brew cask install `brew cask list` && brew cask cleanup
 
# Uncomment the next line if you put https://gist.github.com/SeanSith/c98280a15fd7247cee10
# in your path and wish for old Caskroom software versions to be culled.
